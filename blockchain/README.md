# TruBudget Blockchain

This project encapsulates the Multichain implementation for Trubudget. It can be seen as the data tier in Trubudget

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set `docker-compose` cluster which starts the whole TruBudget application (that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)). It uses the local build of the blockchain and the master-deployments of the TruBudget API and Frontend. The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Master-Node + 1 Slave-Node
- 1 Master API connected to Master-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Master-API

Since the required docker images are located in the private Dockerregistry you need to authenticate.

To do so you simply create a login token by `$ echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD > DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`

If you have set your password token you can simply start the cluster `$ ./start-service.sh`

Enjoy!

## Configuration

The Blockchain node is fully configurated through environment variables.

### Environment Variables

Depending on the Trubudget setup environment variables

Every slave node needs to use the same RPC password in order to be able to connect to the blockchain. <br/>**Hint:** Although the RPC_PASSWORD is not required it is highly recommended to set an own secure one                          |
| RPC_PORT                    | no       | 8000                      | The port used to expose the multichain daemon of your Trubudget blockchain installation(bc).

| EXPOSE_MC    | no       | false         | If set to true, Trubudget tries to expose it's multichain via kubernetes' ingress. First a kubernetes config file is searched in `/.kube/config`. If not found and the MC is deployed in a cluster, it is search for the service account to get the information. After configuration the `externalip` arg is set to the ip of the service' ingress of the configured cluster SERVICE_NAME and NAMESPACE are required to access the ingress of the service. |

## Lifecycle

As described before: The Trubudget Blockchain is created by a master, then grants slaves access on demand.

1.  Start Master-Node of Trubudget Blockchain (Master sets chain configurations for network and has admit privileges)
1.  Start API (Master-API)
1.  API will set up Master-Node for Trubudget (creating Admin-Streams)
1.  Start Slave-Node(s)
1.  Slave-Node will try to join the network by connection to the master-node
    1.  If mutual authentication is enabled, the blockchain can only request to access the network when providing a valid certificate. In case the certificate is not valid, the Master API will reject the node immediately
1.  Slave-Node attempt to access the network will be rejected because they have not been granted access
1.  Slave-Node requests to be granted access to the network by sending its blockchain-address and information about the Organization operating the node to the Master-API
1.  Eventually, Master-API grants read/write (not admin) access to the network for the supplied address
1.  Slave-Node retries to join the network
1.  Slave-Node is granted for access and synchronizes blockchain data

## Master vs. Slave Node

Trubudget is a private Blockchain (BC) network. That means a master need to give new nodes (slaves) a one-time grant in order to access the network. The decision if I want to spawn a Master or a Slave node is simple:

- Masternode: I want to create a new network
- Slavenode: I want to participate on an existing network

## Mutual Authentication

Mutual Authentication is a feature that ensures that only nodes with a valid certificate can access the network.
A node, which wants to access the network, has to authenticate itself against the Master API with a valid certificate.
If the certificate is not valid, the API will reject the request. If the certificate is valid, the API will accept the connection and the user can approve the connection.
More information about mutual authentication can be found [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/access-management/what-is-mutual-authentication/).

## Enable email notifications

If `EMAIL_SERVICE` is set to "ENABLED" and `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT` are set too the multichain-feed is attached to the multichain-daemon and the notification-watcher starts watching the `NOTIFICATION_PATH` for new incoming notification transactions. In other words The blockchain starts the background processes to send user ids to the email-notification service. `EMAIL_SSL` is a flag to define if the connection of the blockchain application and the email-service shall be https(true) or http(false).

The easiest way to get started is to use our pre-set `docker-compose` cluster available in the `email-notification` project which starts the whole TruBudget application including all email components(that means you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)).
The pre-set cluster contains:

- 1 Master-Node
- 1 Master API connected to Master-Node
- 1 Frontend connected to Master-API
- 1 Email-Service
- 1 Email-Database (Postgres)

When started the Email-Service sends email notifications to the configured SMTP-host. The default configuration is:

- SMTP_HOST: host.docker.internal(localhost)
- SMTP_PORT: 2500

More details about the email notification service can be found in the [email notification documentation](../email-notification-service/README.md#)

<!-- TODO: move to Email-Notification Servcie -->

## Disable email notifications

To disable email notifications for blockchain simply set the `EMAIL_SERVICE` to "DISABLED" or unset it.
If disabled the multichain-feed is not applied to the multichain-daemon and notifications are not created.

**Hint:** To prevent the frontend requesting an email-notifications readiness call simply unset the email notification service environment variable in the frontend. More details can be found in the [frontend documentation](../frontend/README.md#email-notifications)
